# ALC Notes
This is App (ALC Notes) displays displays list of notes and info form user input locally and cloud. The cloud notes are also saved locally and can be viewed even if user is offline. The app uses firebase google auth to authenticate users and users can save their dairy to cloud and acces them from other devices when they login their credentials. They can view, edit, share and delete entries. The app has Text to Speech funtion which helps users in pronouncing words and reading.
I named it after the Andela Learning Community because they made this programme successful and I must say that they deserve accolades.
